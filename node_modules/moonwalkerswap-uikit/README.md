## How to Customize UIkit

First clone this repo to local and then start editing the components, theme, etc.

When is finished the Customization of the UIkit build it using:

`npm run build`

Commit everything to the git repo and if you are using a different repo just change it in package.json.

If you have a commit error due to husky you can try:

`git commit -am 'commit' --no-verify`

That should solve the problem, then push to remote repo.

After this you need to [publish the npm package](https://zellwk.com/blog/publish-to-npm/)

Be aware of the versions, If you make an update change the version in package.json so when you publish this's not gonna throw you an error.

Go to the npm package you created and you are ready to use it.
